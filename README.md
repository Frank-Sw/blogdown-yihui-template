This is a skeleton of Yihui Xie's personal website based on [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme [hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme). Main features:

- Minimal style
- Supports blogging with two languages by default (Chinese and English), but can be extended to support any languages.
- You can create sub sites for your projects, too.

Please note that if you clone this repo, make sure to download the submodule under the `themes` directory:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yihui/blogdown-yihui-template.git
```
